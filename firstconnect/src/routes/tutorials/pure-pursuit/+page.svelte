            <p>
                In the world of robotics, being accurate is crucial, especially in the context of competitions like the <strong>FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)</strong> and <strong>FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)</strong>. One key method used in these contests is <strong>Pure Pursuit</strong>. Pure Pursuit helps robots follow a specific path with great precision.

            <p>
                Pure Pursuit works by selecting a point ahead of the robot's path and then steering the robot to reach that point. This helps the robot move smoothly and accurately along the desired path.
            </p>
            <p>
                For FTC and FRC teams, mastering Pure Pursuit can be a game-changer. It allows robots to navigate the field, follow paths, and perform complex tasks with minimal human control.
